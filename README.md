react-priority-nav
==================

React accessible navigational menu that adds overflowing menu items to dropdown menu

Inspiration for this project comes from [@gijsroge](http://www.twitter.com/gijsroge) and his work on [PriorityNav](http://gijsroge.github.io/priority-nav.js/).  Just needed reactifying!
